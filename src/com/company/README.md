#Checkers 2 Electric-Boogaloo

##Summary:

This is a rebuild of my original checkers game. I added in the additional classes (Game, Player) as last minute additions.
As such, the two classes we're very general, lean, and not fully utilized. These notes are meant to help restructure
the original program by moving some code out of Main, and into Game.

The focus this semester will be on modifying the original program to utilize Game more; and also to clean up some of the
code. The original notes will be kept as a base; while these notes will focus on improvements.
